# Bank-Loan
The purpose of this case study is to identify patterns that suggest whether a client may struggle to repay their installments, which could guide decisions making for the bank. This ensures that clients who are capable of repaying are not unfairly rejected. The goal is to use exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify such clients.
